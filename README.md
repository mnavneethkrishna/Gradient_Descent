# Gradient_Descent

A Python 3.5 code using Tensorflow library.

We use Gradient Descent Algorithm to evealuate training accuracy and
print the loss.

Required stuff: 
Python 3.5 or higher;
Google Tensorflow (non-gpu version);
Working python-os library.

Improvements over other code:
Printing of fussy warnings have been avoided with python-os library.

All the best with the Gradient Descent Algorithm!
